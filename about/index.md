## About
After a few attempts I've finally decided to created this blog as a way of dumping information from my brain. Hopefully you'll find some interesting [blog](http://www.adam2marsh.co.uk/blog/) posts on whatever I thought was interesting. I'm also going to have links to any [projects](http://www.adam2marsh.co.uk/projects/) I've worked on; might be a game, a picture I took or something I participated in I'd like to highlight.

At the bottom of every page you'll find ways to get in contact with me, so if you have any comments please get in contact.
