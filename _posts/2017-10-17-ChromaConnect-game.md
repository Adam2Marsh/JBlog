<center><b>Chroma Connect</b> is the colour matching game thats zen and peaceful, that is until you find yourself on totally the wrong colour then its a mad dash swipe to match the colours in time!</center>

## About
This is the second game I worked on and GeekyLeek's first game on Android. After our quick turn around on [ANTs Adventure](https://geekyleek.com/ants-adventures/) we all agreed another quick project would be perfect. Originally we had planned on including Phillips Hue Lighbulb Support but this got pushed to v2 which never got done. At some point I would like to revisit this game and see how easily we could integrate hue support but unsure when/if that will ever happen.
