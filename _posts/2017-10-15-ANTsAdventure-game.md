<center><b>ANTs Adventures</b> is a story of survival.  As you fly through the desert spotting watering holes and catching fish to feed your baby bird family.</center>

## About
First game I worked on with GeekyLeek that was published to the iOS App Store. We took inspiration from Flappy Birds (who didn't) and tried to add our twist to develop a game in a short time period. We'd spent maybe a year working on a platformer which showed promise but quickly ran away from us. After taking a step back and seeing the scale we wanted to give, it didn't seem like a great first game. So in it's ashes ANTs Adventures was born to test our skills at taking a simple formula, giving it something little different and publishing to the world.
