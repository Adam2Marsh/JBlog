Welcome to the first of what I hope to be many blog posts. Over the last few years I've tried multiple times to start a blog; and today is the start of that idea.

My goal is to use this blog as a place I can dump my brain, somewhere to document interesting things and maybe a couple of guides for any projects I work on.
